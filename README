PotMux v1.0

The PotMux is a small hardware add-on for the C64 that allows the user
to optionally route the control port potentiometer lines to a
destination other than the SID. It is mainly intended to be used with
the Keyman64 for the purpose of mapping additional joystick buttons
connected to the potentiometer lines to user defined keystrokes.

For details about the hardware, see ./hardware/README

The potmux utility contained in this archive can be used to prefix an
existing C64 program with a specific potmux configuration for the
Keyman64. The resulting program will first configure the Keyman64
using its serial interface connected to the tapeport lines "Cassette
Sense" and "Cassette Data" and then run the original program.

Usage: potmux [<option>...] <program> [<button|switch>...]

Options:
         -h, --help           : print this help text
         -v, --version        : print version information
         -o, --outfile <file> : output file (default: stdout)

Arguments:
         <program> : C64 program file to patch
         <button>  : route a joystick button to a key
         <switch>  : specify enable line and state

Example:
         potmux -o patched.prg game.prg a0:on b1:space

Assuming that the PotMux EN line is connected to the keyman line on
port a bit 0, the "a0:on" switch specification assures that the potmux
will be enabled by pulling that line low. And assuming that one of the
PotMux button output lines is connected to the keyman control line on
port b bit 1, the "b1:space" will send a space key press when the
corresponding button is pressed.
