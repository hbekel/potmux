PotMux v1.0
===========

The PotMux is a small hardware add-on for the C64 that allows the user
to optionally route the control port potentiometer lines to a
destination other than the SID. It is mainly intended to be used with
the Keyman64 for the purpose of mapping additional joystick buttons
connected to the potentiometer lines to user defined keystrokes.

For details about the hardware, see ./hardware/README

The potmux utility contained in this archive can be used to prefix an
existing C64 program with a specific potmux configuration for the
Keyman64. The resulting program will first configure the Keyman64
using its serial interface connected to the tapeport lines "Cassette
Sense" and "Cassette Data" (see
http://henning-bekel.de/keyman64/#serial-interface) and then run the
original program.
